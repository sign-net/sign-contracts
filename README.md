# Sign CosmWasm Contracts

Sign smart contracts are written in [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com), a multi-chain smart contracting platform in Rust.

Contracts run in a WASM VM on the [Sign Layer 1 blockchain](https://github.com/sign-net/core).

## S-721

Sign's NFT contract s721 is a set of optional extensions on top of [cw721-base](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/tree/main/contracts/cw721-base), and conforms to the [cw721 specification](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/tree/main/packages/cw721).
